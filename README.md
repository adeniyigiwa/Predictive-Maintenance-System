# Proactive IT Management with Predictive Maintenance System

## Description
This notebook implements predictive maintenance for proactive IT management using classification machine learning algorithms. The goal is to predict equipment failure types based on historical data to minimize downtime and maintenance costs.

## Setup
1. **Import Libraries**:
   - `numpy`, `pandas` for data manipulation.
   - `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn` for data visualization.
   - `sklearn` for machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
   - `imbalanced-learn` for handling imbalanced datasets.

2. **Google Drive Mount**: 
   If using Google Colab, ensure your dataset is accessible by mounting Google Drive.

3. **Load Dataset**:
   Import the predictive maintenance dataset from a specified path into a DataFrame using `pd.read_csv`.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1. **General Information**:
   - Inspect the dataset structure using `.info()` and `.head()` to understand data types, missing values, and sample data.
   
2. **Failure Type Distribution**:
   - Analyze the class distribution of target variables `Failure Type` and `Target` using value counts and pie plots.

3. **Feature Visualization**:
   - Visualize pair-wise relationships between features using `sns.pairplot`.
   - Create visualizations for categorical features (`Type`, `Target`, etc.) to uncover patterns.

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Encode Categorical Features**:
   - **Ordinal Encoding** for `Type` (L/M/H).
   - **Label Encoding** for `Failure Type`.

2. **Train-Test Split**:
   - Use `train_test_split` to partition the data into training (80%) and test (20%) datasets.

3. **Imbalanced Dataset Handling**:
   - Apply **SMOTE** to rebalance the training data.

## Model Training and Evaluation
1. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Train and evaluate a logistic regression model.
   - Report training and test accuracies and the classification report.

2. **Decision Tree**:
   - Train and evaluate a decision tree classifier.
   - Report training and test accuracies and the classification report.

3. **Random Forest**:
   - Train and evaluate a random forest classifier.
   - Report training and test accuracies and the classification report.

4. **Ensemble Models**:
   - **Voting Classifier**:
     - Combine RandomForest, KNeighbors, and SVC in a voting classifier.
     - Report training and test accuracies and the classification report.

   - **Stacking Classifier**:
     - Stack RandomForest, KNeighbors, and SVC with a final logistic regression estimator.
     - Report training and test accuracies and the classification report.

## Model Optimization
1. **GridSearchCV**:
   - Tune hyperparameters for individual models using GridSearchCV with cross-validation.
   - Integrate optimized models in ensemble voting classifiers.

## Evaluation Metrics
1. **Classification Reports**:
   - Generate detailed classification reports for model performance.

2. **Confusion Matrix**:
   - Plot the confusion matrix for stacking model predictions.

3. **Confidence Intervals**:
   - Calculate confidence intervals using bootstrapping for the ensemble model's accuracy.

## Conclusion
- This notebook provides a structured approach to predictive maintenance by implementing, fine-tuning, and evaluating various machine learning classifiers.
- The final stacking ensemble provides high classification accuracy across different failure types, highlighting the benefits of model ensembling in predictive maintenance applications.
